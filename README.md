# Mortgage Calculator

This is a very simple lightning component that I was using as a way of expanding my knowledge with Lightning Components and SFDX. I picked a Mortgage Calculator because the workings behind it is more complex than your average showing a list of records or creating a new record which I feel I now have a good grasp of. This one required me to grab values on change and dynamically calculate a new value then display it back on screen. It took a while to figure out how to do this in javascript and even now I think some of the calculations I need to update but as far as learning how to take values, process a calculation and then return it back to screen goes I feel I learnt what I wanted.
